## 🎯 Vision

Building the next generation of **privacy-first, offline-first** tools that put security and user freedom at the core. I'm deep in the trenches of **Red Team operations**, **AI systems**, and **low-level programming**—creating software that's fast, transparent, and untethered from the cloud.

My mission: Democratize cybersecurity knowledge and build tools that empower ethical hackers, privacy advocates, and developers who refuse to compromise on security.

### 🛡️ Core Principles
- **Privacy by Design** - Your data stays yours, always offline-capable
- **Open Source First** - Transparency builds trust
- **Performance Obsessed** - Native speed, minimal bloat
- **Security Focused** - Built with threat models in mind
