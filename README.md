## Vision
Building the next generation of privacy-first, offline-first tools that place security and user sovereignty at the core. Specializing in red team operations, AI systems, low-level programming, and high-performance software that operates independently of the cloud.

Mission: Democratize cybersecurity knowledge and create powerful, transparent tools for ethical hackers, privacy advocates, and developers who prioritize freedom and security.

## Core Principles
- Privacy by Design – Data remains local and fully offline-capable  
- Open Source First – Transparency builds lasting trust  
- Performance Obsessed – Native speed with minimal overhead  
- Security Focused – Designed against real-world threat models
